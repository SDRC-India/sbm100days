Speaking on the occasion, the President congratulated Shri Sunil Jaglan on the launch of the mobile-app ‘Selfie-with-Daughter’. He said that Shri Jaglan’s efforts in initiating this campaign in Haryana are praiseworthy. Selfie-with-Daughter has become a world-wide movement against female foeticide and sex selection. He hoped that this would eventually help in dealing with the problems arising out of gender imbalance. He stated that the App is an innovative concept and an act of gentle persuasion. He urged people to take photographs with their daughters and upload on the App to make the campaign a success.The ‘Selfie with Daughter’ campaign was started by Shri Sunil Jaglan in June 2015 in village Bibipur, Jind, Haryana. A former Sarpanch, Shri Jaglan has been working in the field of women empowerment and village development. The aim of the campaign is to motivate society to feel proud to be parents of a girl child which will result in improving the child sex ratio.",
